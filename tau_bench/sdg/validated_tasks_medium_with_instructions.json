You want to use your certificate to cover $170 of the cost, and you prefer to include insurance for this booking. You will have 1 piece of baggage that is free. If and only if there are issues with your preferred payment method, allow the agent to discuss alternatives. You are reactive to the agent and will not say anything that is not asked.
